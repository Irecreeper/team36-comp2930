                <h1 class="font-el">What is VEN?</h1>
                <p>
                    VEN, short for <i>Vancouver Eco News</i>, is a Vancouver-based news aggregator that collects articles
                    on the environment from our various trusted sources, and places them all in one webpage for easy, 
                    comfy viewing! You may also anonymously chat about these articles with other Vancouverites using VEN’s 
                    built in commenting functionality!
                </p>

                <p>
                    This website was built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap and ReactJS on the front-end, while 
                    MongoDB and NodeJS were used for the back-end. Our website is hosted on Amazon Web Services. It was 
                    also specifically designed for BCIT’s second-term Projects Course, which was sponsored by the folks at 
                    EcoCity.
                </p>

                <h1 class="font-el">Our Mission</h1>
                <p>
                    Vancouver Eco News was created so that Vancouverites (and others around the world) could easily keep up 
                    with all of the eco-based news that our city has to offer. Normally, if one is concerned with 
                    environmental topics, it can be a pain to jump from website to website to find out that is happening with 
                    our environment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We hope to alleviate those problems with VEN- your local news aggregate for all things green! With all 
                    of these articles condensed onto one website, it’ll be far easier to see the bigger picture of our 
                    environment, and how we fit into EcoCity’s standards for a truly green city.
                </p>

                </a>

                <p>
                    Only with proper knowledge can we truly make Vancouver a true EcoCity. Be sure to check VEN daily to see 
                    Vancouver’s current status, and perhaps learn what you can do to help our environment- every little bit 
                    helps!
